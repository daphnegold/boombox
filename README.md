![boombox.rb](/app/assets/images/readme.png)

A website for submitting, upvoting, and listening to songs.

Developed for my Thanksgiving break project for Ada Developers Academy Cohort 4.

This site is built with Ruby on Rails and is still a work in progress.  There are several aspects that still not fully developed: 
* RSpec testing
* Spotify integration
* User details page
* Continuous music playback

(Heroku has not been updated since Thanksgiving. The code and styling have changed substantially since then.)
